# Design Philosophy

This living document describes some Go design philosophies we endeavor to incorporate when working, building, or writing in Go.

## General

1. Prefer easy to understand over easy to do
2. First do it, then do it right, then do it better, then make it testable [14]
3. When you spawn goroutines, make it clear when - or whether - they exit. [2]
4. Packages that are imported only for their side effects should be avoided [4]
5. Package level and global variables should be avoided
6. magic is bad; global state is magic â†’ no package level vars; no func init [13]

## Dependencies

1. External dependencies should be tried and fail fast or just keep trying
   - For example, external connections, port binding, environment variables, secrets, etc
   - Examples of "failing fast"
     - Try external connections immediately
     - Binding to ports immediately
   - Examples of "keep trying"
     - Block ingress traffic or calls until external connections are successful
       - Should be accompanied by some way to check health status of external connections
2. Make all dependencies explicit [11]

## Naming

1. Naming general rules [12]
   - Structs are plain nouns: API, Replica, Object
   - Interfaces are active nouns: Reader, Writer, JobProcessor
   - Functions and methods are verbs: Read, Process, Sync
2. Package names [15]
   - Short: no more than one word
   - No plural
   - Lower case
   - Informative about the service it provides
   - Avoid packages named utility/utilities or model/models
3. Avoid renaming imports except to avoid a name collision; good package names should not require renaming [3]

## Interfaces

1. Accept interfaces, return structs [5]
2. Small interfaces are better [6]
3. Define an interface when you actually need it, not when you foresee needing it [7]
4. Interfaces [15]
   - Use interfaces as function/method arguments & as field types
   - Small interfaces are better

## Functions/Methods

1. All top-level, exported names should have doc comments, as should non-trivial unexported type or function declarations. [1]
2. Methods/functions [15]
   - One function has one goal
   - Simple names
   - Reduce the number of nesting levels
3. Only func main has the right to decide which flags, env variables, config files are available to the user [10a],[10b]
4. `context.Context` should, in most cases, be the first argument of all functions or methods
5. Prefer synchronous functions - functions which return their results directly or finish any callbacks or channel ops before returning - over asynchronous ones. [8]

## Errors

1. Error Handling [15]
   - Func `main` should normally be the only one calling fatal errors or `os.Exit`

## Source files

1. One file should be named like the package [9]
2. One file = One responsibility [9]
3. If you only have one command prefer a top level `main.go`, if you have more than one command put them in a `cmd/` package
