# Boots

[![Build Status](https://github.com/tinkerbell/boots/workflows/For%20each%20commit%20and%20PR/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tinkerbell/boots/actions?query=workflow%3A%22For+each+commit+and+PR%22+branch%3Amaster)

This services handles DHCP, PXE, tftp, and iPXE for provisions.

This repository is [Experimental](https://github.com/packethost/standards/blob/master/experimental-statement.md) meaning that it's based on untested ideas or techniques and not yet established or finalized or involves a radically new and innovative style!
This means that support is best effort (at best!) and we strongly encourage you to NOT use this in production.

## Running Boots

As boots runs a DHCP server, it's often asked if it is safe to run without any network isolation; the answer is yes. While boots does run a DHCP server, it only allocates an IP address when it recognizes the mac address of the requesting device.

### Local Setup

First, you need to make sure you have [git-lfs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) installed:

```
# install "git-lfs" package for your OS. On Ubuntu, for instance:
# curl https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
# apt install git-lfs

# then run these two commands:
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

Running the Tests

```
# make the files
make all
# run the tests
go test
```

Build/Run Boots

```
# run boots
./boots
```

You can use NixOS shell, which will have the Git-LFS, Go and others

`nix-shell`

### Developing with Standalone Mode

The quickest way to get started is `docker-compose up`. This will start boots in
standalone mode using the example JSON in the `test/` directory. It also starts
a client container that runs some tests.

```sh
docker-compose build # build containers
docker-compose up    # start the network & services
# it's fine to hit control-C twice for fast shutdown
docker-compose down  # stop the network & clean up Docker processes
```

Alternatively you can run boots standalone manually. It requires a few
environment variables for configuration.

`test/standalone-hardware.json` should be safe enough for most developers to
use on the command line locally without getting a call from your network
administrator. That said, you might want to contact them before running a DHCP
server on their network. Best to isolate it in Docker or a VM if you're not
sure.

```sh
export DATA_MODEL_VERSION=standalone
export API_CONSUMER_TOKEN=none
export API_AUTH_TOKEN=none
export BOOTS_STANDALONE_JSON=./test/standalone-hardware.json

# to run on your laptop as a regular user
# DHCP won't work but useful for smoke testing and iterating on http/tftp/syslog
./cmd/boots/boots \
	-http-addr 127.0.0.1:9000 \
	-syslog-addr 127.0.0.1:9001 \
	-tftp-addr 127.0.0.01:9002 \
	-dhcp-addr 127.0.0.1:9003

# or run it in a container
# NOTE: not sure the NET_ADMIN cap is necessary
docker run -ti --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --volume $(pwd):/boots alpine:3.14
/boots/cmd/boots -dhcp-addr 0.0.0.0:67
```
