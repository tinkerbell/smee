# opentelemetry-collector is a proxy for telemetry events.
#
# This configuration is set up for use in boots development.
# With collector in debug mode every trace is printed to the console
# so you can see traces without any complex tooling. There are also
# examples below for how to send to Lightstep and Honeycomb.
